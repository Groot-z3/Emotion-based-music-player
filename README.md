# Emotion-Based Music Player 🎵

An emotion-aware music player that uses real-time facial emotion recognition to automatically play music based on the user's detected emotional state.

## Overview

This project combines computer vision and emotion analysis to create a personalized music listening experience. Using a webcam feed, the application detects the user's facial expression, classifies the emotion, and automatically plays music associated with the detected mood.

The application features an interactive Streamlit interface for real-time emotion detection and music playback.
